## Tools We Use

Right now the two most important tools are Airtable and Slack. Make sure you've been invited to and joined both.

Airtable contains two important lists:
- The list of 200 OK members
- The list of startups who have reached out

Please consider all of this information to be *private* unless it is explicitly marked as "published to the website".

## Updating Your Profile

Please make sure your information is correct and to your liking. You can update your information anytime. If you'd like to get an update published to the website, just ping Carter in Slack.

## Viewing a List of Startups

In Airtable, there is a list of Startups that we are engaged with. 

**Please consider 100% of this information to be confidential**. 

It takes years to earn trust and just minutes to lose it, so please keep keep discussions about these companies inside our private channels.

## Registering Interest in a Startup

In the Startup table you'll see a column called "Interest List". Please add yourself to any startup that you're interested in. Interest just means that you will be included on emails/invitations/chatter about the startup. It doesn’t mean anything beyond that. The bar for “interest” should not be too high.
