## Tools We Use

Right now the two most important tools are Airtable and Slack. Make sure you've joined both.

Airtable contains two important lists:
- The list of 200 OK members
- The list of startups who have reached out

Please consider all of this information to be *private* unless it is explicitly marked as "published to the website".
