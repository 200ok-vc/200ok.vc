## Registering Interest in a Startup

As startups reach out to us, please make sure you indicate the ones that you'd like to learn more about.

In the Startup table you'll see a column called "Interest List". Please add yourself to any startup that you're interested in. Interest just means that you will be included on emails/invitations/chatter about the startup. It doesn’t mean anything beyond that. The bar for “interest” should not be too high.

## Discussing Startups

Whenever more than one member is "interested" in a startup, we will create a channel to house discussion of the company. 

<span class="highlight">If you have a conflict of interest, please do not join these channels.</span>

## Investing in a Startup

There are two main ways that you can invest in a startup that you're excited about:
### Investing Directly

If you are excited about a startup and they are excited about having you onboard as an investor, they may offer you the opportunity to make a direct investment in their round. Startups often reserve space in their round for "strategic angels". These are people who have specific skills or connections that can help accelerate and de-risk the startup. 

This is a fantastic way to invest in a company you believe in and have some agency in whether or not they are successful. The downside is that this can become time consuming, depending on your level of involvement and the number of other companies you have invested in.
### Investing Via the 200 OK Syndicate

For situations where you want to make a smaller investment and/or the startup is looking for a larger check, you can invest in deals that are run through the [200 OK Syndicate](https://angel.co/s/http-200-ok/w7Q2q). The Syndicate is set-up with no fees and no carry, so it's just a tool for pooling resources and making bigger investments.
