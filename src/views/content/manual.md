## Tools We Use

Right now the two most important tools are Airtable and Slack. Make sure you've been invited to and joined both.

## Airtable

Airtable contains two important lists:
- The list of 200 OK members
- The list of startups who have reached out

Please consider all of this information to be *private* unless it is explicitly marked as "published to the website".

### Viewing a List of Members

In Airtable, there is a list of Members, including yourself. The public information for all Members will be published to the website. Right now public information consists of:

- Full Name
- Photo
- Bio
- Super Powers
- Website

### Updating Your Profile

Please make sure your information is correct and to your liking. You can update your information anytime. If you'd like to get an update published to the website, just ping Carter in Slack.

### Viewing a List of Startups

In Airtable, there is a list of Startups that we are engaged with. Entries are added to this table in two ways:

1. They are added when a founder submit as API request to our website
2. They are added manually by a member

When a startup is added via the API, the #inbound channel in Slack gets pinged.

<span class="highlight">Please consider 100% of this information to be confidential.</span>

It takes years to earn trust and just minutes to lose it, so please keep keep discussions about these companies inside our private channels.

### Registering Interest in a Startup

As startups reach out to us, please make sure you indicate the ones that you'd like to learn more about.

In the Startup table you'll see a column called "Interest List". Please add yourself to any startup that you're interested in. Interest just means that you will be included on emails/invitations/chatter about the startup. It doesn’t mean anything beyond that. The bar for “interest” should not be too high.

## Slack

### Discussing Startups

Whenever more than one member is "interested" in a startup, we will create a channel to house discussion of the company. 

<span class="highlight">If you have a conflict of interest, please do not join these channels.</span>
