## What is 200 OK Ventures?

200 OK Ventures is a friendly group of angel investors who have all worked at API and platform startups.

Our goal is to help founders who are building the next generation of developer-centric companies.

## What kind of help do you provide?

First, we provide feedback to founders on their product and help them think about bringing it to market.

Second, we write checks. Our check sizes range from $5k - $25k.

## Are you willing to write bigger checks as a syndicate?

Maybe! But we prefer not to. We feel that the primary value of the people here at 200 OK is their personal experience scaling up successful venture-scale companies. Ideally, a founder will identify folks from 200 OK that they want to build a relationship with and have onboard as individual investors, who they can look forward to working with after the seed round in closed.

## What happens after I make that POST request?

Our API sends the content of the POST request to our Slack channel. Once one of our members gets a chance to review it, they will reach out via the email provided in the POST request. So please provide a valid email address.

## Ok, what happens after that?

- We will reach out to say "hello".
- We'll ask you where you are regarding fundraising (from "not planning on it" to "closing next week")
- We'll ask you how we can help
- We'll schedule a time for you to demo your product (MVPs and prototypes are ok) to the group

## What is the point of the demo?

Most founder/VC meetings revolve around a pitch. We prefer to skip the fake financial projections and Techcrunch hype, and focus instead on the product. We're interested in the demo because we can learn:

- What the product does.
- Who it's designed for.
- The problem is solves.
- Why you think this problem is important.

We feel like this process provides founders with high-quality feedback on their product and how they're thinking of bringing it to market. It provides us a great feel for whether we should continue learning more and consider making an investment.
