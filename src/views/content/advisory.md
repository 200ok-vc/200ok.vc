If you are interested in taking the time to meet founders who reach out to us, join our Advisory. There are two immediate ways in which we try to help:

1. Provide feedback on their idea and demo.
2. Understand their challenges and connect them to people &amp; resources that can help.

We're also happy to discuss investing in pre-seed or seed rounds. If there is interest in the deal by one or more members of Advisory, we can:

- Directly invest in the round.
- Lead a deal through the 200 OK Syndicate.
- Serve as an advisor.
