title: Welcome!

Thank you for joining our merry little band of hacker investors! Here are the next (super simple) steps:

## Joining Slack

You will recieve an invitation to join our Slack at the email you provided.

Once you recieve the invitation, please join and introduce yourself. Doesn't need to be fancy.

## Access to the Airtable

You will also recieve an invitation to join our Airtable.

We are using Airtable for pretty much everything. Update your bio? Airtable. Review a pitch deck? Airtable.

## Updating the Website

The information you submitted in the form will be used to add your information to the website. If there's anything you'd like to change (photo, bio, etc) just change it in the Airtable (once you've been granted access) and then ping us in Slack to let us know you'd like us to re-build the website.

## Review the Code of Conduct

Finally, please review our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct). It's not just a list of what not to do, it's a good guide for the kind of engagement and assistance we expect all members to provide. We are building a *community of learning* and we need everyone to contribute in order to make this happen. Thank you!

## Next steps?

Please review the [200 OK Manual](/manual). I will do my best to keep this up-to-date and hopefully it will answer most of your questions in terms of where information is or what you're supposed to do.
