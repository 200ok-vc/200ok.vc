title: Sharing Deals
---
The world of investors who are passionate about dev tools is not very big, so let's all work together to support founders who are working in this space.

## Connect us to founders

Send founders that you think we should connect with to [200ok.vc/founders](/founders). This is much better than an email intro, because it helps the founder better understand what we do (and what we don't do) and decide if it's a good fit for them.

## Share deals with us

If there's an active deal that a startup would like to get in front of the folks at 200 OK, please send the relevant info to: deals@200ok.vc

## Hear about startups and deals that we think are interesting

Likewise, when we hear about deals that founders allow us to share more broadly, we send them out to our mailing list. If you'd like to hear about these deals, please subscribe below.
