title: 200 OK for Investors
---
There are a few ways you, as an investor, can participate in what we're building at 200 OK:
## 1) Become a Member

Our mission is to build a diverse and inclusive group of angel investors who care about helping founders build the next generation of dev tools. We have only three criteria:

- You are an [accredited investor](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/what-is-an-accredited-investor/)
- You have worked in an operational role at an early stage dev tool startup
- You are willing to put in the time to talk to founders, do diligence and help source deals

## 2) Join our Syndicate

Every now and then a deal comes through that a bunch of us are really excited about. If the founder is up for allocating at least $100k for 200 OK, we will provide access to this deal through our syndicate.
