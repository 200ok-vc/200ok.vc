A (hopefully) handy guide to being a Member of 200 OK. PRs welcome!

## Sourcing deals

If you meet a startup that you think is a good fit for 200 OK, please simply point them to [200ok.vc/founders](/founders).

## Discussing startups

Whenever more than one member is interested in a startup, we will create a channel to house discussion of the startup and let everyone know.

<span class="highlight">If you have a conflict of interest, please do not join these channels.</span>

## Investing in a startup

There are two main ways that you can invest in a startup that you're excited about:

### Investing Directly

If you are excited about a startup and they are excited about having you onboard as an investor, they may offer you the opportunity to make a direct investment in their round. Startups often reserve space in their round for "strategic angels". These are people who have specific skills or connections that can help accelerate and de-risk the startup.

This is a fantastic way to invest in a company you believe in and have some agency in whether or not they are successful. The downside is that this can become time consuming, depending on your level of involvement and the number of other companies you have invested in.

### Investing Via the 200 OK Syndicate

For situations where you want to make a smaller investment and/or the startup is looking for a larger check, you can invest in deals that are run through the [200 OK Syndicate](https://angel.co/s/http-200-ok/w7Q2q). The Syndicate is set-up with no fees and no carry, so it's just a tool for pooling resources and making bigger investments.
