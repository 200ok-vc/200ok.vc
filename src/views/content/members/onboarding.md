title: Welcome to 200 OK!
---

Thank you for joining our merry little band of hacker investors! Here are the next (super simple) steps:

## 1) Review the Code of Conduct

Please review our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct). It's not just a list of what not to do, it's a good guide for the kind of engagement and assistance we expect all members to provide. We are building a _community of learning_ and we need everyone to contribute in order to make this happen.

## 2) Join the Syndicate

When you're ready, there are two ways you can make investments: writing an individual check to a startup or by investing through a syndicate. A syndicate lets investors make smaller investments (minimum of $1000) that get pooled into a single, larger check for the startup.

Joing the 200 OK Syndicate does not cost anything and does not commit you to making any investments. Those decision happen on a deal by deal basis. So please [join the syndicate](https://angel.co/s/http-200-ok/w7Q2q) and create an AngelList profile if you don't already have one.

## Next steps?

Please review the [Member Manual](/members/manual). We will keep this up-to-date and hopefully it will answer most of your questions in terms of where information is or how to get things done.
