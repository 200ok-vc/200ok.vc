title: Membership
---
Our mission is to build a diverse and inclusive group of angel investors who care about helping founders build the next generation of dev tools. We have only three criteria:

- You are an [accredited investor](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/what-is-an-accredited-investor/)
- You have worked in an operational role at an early stage dev tool startup
- You are willing to put in the time to talk to founders and/or learn how to angel invest

### The Advisory 

If you are interested in taking the time to meet founders who reach out to us, join our Advisory. There are two immediate ways in which we try to help:

1. Provide feedback on their idea and demo.
2. Understand their challenges and connect them to people &amp; resources that can help.

We're also happy to discuss investing in pre-seed or seed rounds. If there is interest in the deal by one or more members of Advisory, we can:

- Directly invest in the round.
- Lead a deal through the 200 OK Syndicate.
- Serve as an advisor.

### The Learning Club

If you're early in your journey as an angel investor, you might find the subject pretty intimidating. If you would like to learn "how to angel" with other folks from the dev tools space, join our Learning Club.

We are still figuring things out, but here's what you can expect:

- Time commitment = 1-2 hours/month
- Communication = Slack + Zoom calls
