title: 200 OK for Founders
---
200 OK is a friendly group of angel investors who have all worked at API and platform startups and our goal is to help founders who are building the next generation of developer-centric companies. Here's a quick summary of how we operate:

* We target pre-seed and seed stage investments.
* We prefer to talk to folks who have at least built a prototype that they can demo.
* We lean towards teams with at least one technical founder.
* We try to match you with strategic angels who are interested in investing and able to help your company take the next step.

## FAQ

### What kind of help do you provide?

During the initial call, we provide feedback on your demo and pointers to any people or resources that we think can help move you forward. The closer you are to having built something that you can demo or (better) we can actually play with, the more we can provide actionable feedback.

If there's interest in investing, we work to make that happen quickly. We feel that the primary value of the people here at 200 OK is their personal experience scaling up successful, venture-scale dev tool companies. We work to help you identify folks from 200 OK that you want to build a relationship with and have onboard as strategic investors.

### Are you willing to write bigger checks as a syndicate?

Sure! For founders who are not looking for strategic angels and would prefer a single, larger check we have set-up the [200 OK Syndicate](/syndicate).  

### What happens after I make that POST request?

Our API sends the content of the POST request to our Slack channel and triggers an automated email to the person who submitted the request (so please provide a valid email address). Althoug the email is automated, the reply-to goes to a real person, so please respond and let us know how we can help!

### Ok, what happens after that?

If possible, we'll schedule a time for you to demo your product (MVPs and prototypes are ok) to a few folks from 200 OK.

### What is the point of the demo?

Most founder/VC meetings revolve around a pitch. We prefer to skip the contrived financial projections and Techcrunch hype, and focus instead on the product. We're interested in the demo because we can learn:

- What the product does.
- Who it's designed for.
- The problem is solves.
- Why you think this problem is important.

We feel like this process provides founders with high-quality feedback on their product and how they're thinking of bringing it to market. It provides us a great feel for whether we should continue learning more and consider making an investment.
