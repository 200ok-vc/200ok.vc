title: 200 OK for Founders
---
For founders who are seeking investment or advisory, here is how we operate:

* We target pre-seed and seed stage investments.
* We prefer to talk to folks who have at least built a prototype that they can demo.
* We lean towards teams with at least one technical founder.
* We try to match you with strategic angels who are interested in investing and able to help your company take the next step.

## FAQ
### What kind of help do you provide?

During the initial call, we try to discuss 3 things:

1. The product you're building (a live demo is best)
2. Your fundraising goals (amount, cap, timing, etc)
3. What you need help with outside of fundraising

Following the call we provide feedback on your demo and pointers to any people or resources that we think can help move you forward.

If there's interest in investing, we work to make that happen quickly. We feel that the primary value of the people here at 200 OK is their personal experience scaling up successful, venture-scale dev tool companies. We work to help you identify folks from 200 OK that you want to build a relationship with and have onboard as strategic investors.

### Are you willing to write bigger checks as a syndicate?

Sure! For founders who are not looking for strategic angels and would prefer a single, larger check we have set-up the [200 OK Syndicate](/network/syndicate).  

### Do you offer Advisory Services?

We focus on making investments in startups and providing assistance alongside that investment. However, if you need more time from someone in our group, you should feel free to reach out to them and propose a formal advisory relationship. The [FAST](https://fi.co/fast) agreement from Founders Institute is a useful tool here.
