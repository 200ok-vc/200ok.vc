    <p>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹</p>
    <p>200 OK Ventures is a friendly group of angel investors who have all worked at API and platform startups. We know how hard it can be to design APIs that developers love, scale up and secure those services, keep documentation up-to-date and a host of other unique challenges that developer-centric startups run into every day.</p>
    <section id="founders">
        <h1>Working With Founders</h1>
        <p>We write individual checks as strategic angel investors. Our members have deep operational experience in bringing dev tools to market, whether it's hiring your first <a href="/members?skills=DevRel">DevRel</a> employee or <a href="/members?skills=Sales">selling</a> into the Enterprise.</p>
        <p>We also pool our resources through our <a href="/syndicate">200 OK Syndicate</a> for founders who are looking for larger checks and need less direct assistance from members of our group.</p>
