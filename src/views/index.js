    <p>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹</p>
    <p>200 OK Ventures is a friendly group of angel investors who have all worked at API and platform startups.</p>
    <p>We know how hard it can be to design APIs that developers love, scale up and secure those services, keep documentation up-to-date and a host of other unique challenges that developer-centric startups run into every day.</p>
    <section id="how-we-help">
        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>We write individual checks as strategic angel investors. Our members have deep operational experience in bringing dev tools to market, whether it's hiring your first <a href="/members?skills=DevRel">DevRel</a> employee or <a href="/members?skills=Sales">selling</a> into the Enterprise. 
        <p>We also pool our resources through our <a href="/syndicate">200 OK Syndicate</a> for founders who are looking for larger checks and need less assistance from our group.</p>
